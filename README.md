# LWJGL-Helper-Library

This affront to god was created when Java Swing was too slow for my strategy game. I wanted to switch to OpenGL, so figured I would need some helper library to make that less painful, so I made this. I think it made it worse. The code seems to have broken since I last worked on it, but I don't care about this anymore.
